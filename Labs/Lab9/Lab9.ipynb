    "According to wikipedia, \"the Kepler telescope is a retired space telescope launched by NASA to discover Earth-size planets orbiting other stars... After nine years of operation, the telescope's reaction control system fuel was depleted, and NASA announced its retirement on October 30, 2018.\" The telescope helped astronomers and a community of scientists confirm over 2000 planet detections. You can read about the Kepler mission [here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html)\n",

    "Kepler's spiritual successor, TESS, is the \"Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite... a space telescope... designed to search for exoplanets using the transit method in an area 400 times larger than that covered by the Kepler mission.\" Data from TESS is still being beamed down to Earth, but a large number of exoplanets have already been confirmed using TESS. You can read more about the TESS mission [here](https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-tess)\n",

    "Both Kepler and TESS discover planets using the transit method: they measure how the light from a star dims as a planet orbiting that star passes in front of it (transits). Bigger planets closer to their host stars will therefore be easier to detect; the survey is biased towards these detections. We might expect, then, that the data we collect from Kepler or TESS might not be representative of the total exoplanet population."
