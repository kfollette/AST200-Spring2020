Generally speaking, bounding boxes are rather ugly, so you should nearly always (unless you really want to set the legend apart) use the optional Boolean (True or False) keyword \"frameon\" to turn this off. Legend also takes the optional keyword loc to set the location of the legend. Loc should be a string, and you can see the full list of options by accessing help for the legend function by hitting shift+tab+tab inside of the plt.legend parentheses below."
